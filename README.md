# Symbolic_Named_Entity_Recognizer-INFO-555-Project-1-
## Project Overview

This project implements a **Symbolic NLP based Named Entity Recognition (NER)** system using rule-based methods. The system identifies and extracts entities like **Names, Dates, Locations**, and **Organizations** from the text using the **NLTK** and other Python libraries. It mainly focuses on how symbolic approaches impact the  NER process. we took chunking and regex operations in the symbolic NLP and applied them in the code functions. The code is written beautifully with the proper markdowns and comments,so it's easier to read the code.  

## Features

- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** for key entities: Names, Dates, Locations, and Organizations.
- **Symbolic rule-based approach** using the linguistic patterns.
- **Evaluation metrics For each Entity**: Precision, Recall, and F1-Score .
- **Comprehensive testing** on the **WikiANN** dataset.

## To Run This Code:
1. Make sure ,you have the python's version as 3.8 or higher.you can install all the necessary packages through :

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

2. After that, just run thecode cells one-by-line as in the .ipynb file .
